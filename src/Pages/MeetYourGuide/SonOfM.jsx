          Shoaib Aftab grew up right here in Bumburet Valley — surrounded by the
          mountains, festivals, and stories that make the Kalash culture so
          alive. As the son of your hosts at Kalash Villa, he’s been welcoming
          guests since he was old enough to carry tea trays and tell stories
          around the fire.
          <br />
          He later earned a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism, which only deepened
          his love for storytelling. Now, he blends that skill with his roots —
          guiding travelers through the valley he calls home, sharing the
          history, myths, and everyday life of his people with warmth and
          honesty. When you walk the trails with Shoaib, you don’t just see the
          valley — you feel it. Every stop has a story, every path a bit of
          laughter, and by the end, most guests say they’ve found not just a
          guide, but a friend.
